Now that you have your first page written, you need to save it to your 
computer’s hard disk, and then open it up in a different program (your 
web browser). This part can be a little tricky, so please follow along 
closely.

When you double-click a 
file on your computer’s desktop, the computer knows what program to open 
the file in by checking the file’s “extension”. This is the characters that 
come after the name of the file. So, for example, .mp3 files will open in a 
program that can play music, and .txt files will open in a text editor.
